So, just as "rules of farming corn" exist, <match> in the sense that </match> there are procedures that result in successful corn farming and those procedures can be discovered and described, so also "rules of reason" exist, in the same sense that there are procedures that result in successful reasoning (i.e. reasoning that leads to true conclusions—or in the case if induction, reasoning that leads more often than not to true conclusions), and those procedures can in turn be discovered and described.

At the risk of being as repetitive as so much of this discussion has been, neither you nor anyone else has demonstrated that it doesn’t “solve the problem of atomic replacement” more than adequately when combined with fsync in the appropriate location. ¦ In fact, that combination solves that specific problem *better* than a new rename variety would <match> in the sense that </match> it preserves the logical distinction between data updates and unrelated metadata updates that has been a feature of the defined Unix interface just about forever. 
In simple terms, consciousness escapes itself both because it is intentional (consciousness always targets an object other than itself) and temporal (consciousness is necessarily future oriented) ( Being and Nothingness , pp. 573-4 and 568) . ¦ Sartre’s view that human freedom consists in consciousness’ ability to escape the present is “ontological” <match> in the sense that </match> no normal human being can fail to be free.

Hart understands his theory of law to be both descriptive and general <match> in the sense that </match> it provides an account of fundamental features common to all legal systems-which presupposes a point of view that is external to all legal systems. 
It must be correct <match> in the sense that </match> every person’s plan is based on the expectation of just those actions of other people which those other people intend to perform, and that all these plans are based on the expectation of the same set of external facts, so that under certain conditions nobody will have any reason to change his plans.

First, Fuller rejects the classical naturalist view that there are necessary moral constraints on the content of law, holding instead that there are necessary moral constraints on the procedural mechanisms by which law is made and administered: “What I have called the internal morality of law is … a procedural version of natural law … [<match> in the sense that </match> it is] concerned, not with the substantive aims of legal rules, but with the ways in which a system of rules for governing human conduct must be constructed and administered if it is to be efficacious and at the same time remain what it purports to be” (Fuller 1964, 96- 97). 
 From the very fact that we ask for temporal things not as the principal object of our petition , but as subordinate to something else, we ask God for them <match> in the sense that </match> they may be granted to us in so far as they are expedient for salvation .

The mirage Pippin is aiming to remove is of some independent fact of the matter that is external to the practices that define agency/responsibility and their limits (‘external’ <match> in the sense that </match> such a fact could presumably be described either by science or via some privileged access by the individuals themselves). 
Obviously, then, when Hosea's reference to the greatness of "the day of Jezreel" is read in its broader context, one can easily see that he was not using it <match> in the sense that </match> Jayawardena claims but in the symbolic sense of conditions that would reunify the Israelite kingdom.

John interprets Mary's anointing of Jesus as royal Messiah not <match> in the same sense that </match> the crowd in John 6 wanted to make Jesus king, but in the sense that kingship for Jesus meant suffering, death, and burial.

 Yet, his claim that video games embody a new form of political transparency in a "relatively unmediated" fashion is misleading.11 Granted, this is partially true <match> in the sense that </match> video games are informatic systems, assemblages of code and algorithms, and thus directly embody the logic upon which a control or networked society depends.
